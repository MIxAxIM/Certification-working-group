## Working Group Aim

The aim of the Cardano Certification Alliance (CCA) working group is to represent, foster and sustain audit and certification on the Cardano blockchain.

## Working Group Responsibilities

In more detail, we see it as developing and maintaining best practice standards for audit and certification, as well as championing the process of certification. Beyond that we see potential for roadmapping tools and technologies, for fostering collaboration between tool builders and providers, interaction with similar bodies for other blockchains, and so forth.
