# Cardano Threat Intelligence

Cardano Threat Intelligence refers to the practice of gathering and analyzing information about potential threats to the Cardano blockchain platform. This information is then used to identify and mitigate potential security risks.

## Why is Cardano Threat Intelligence important?

As Cardano continues to gain popularity and adoption around the world, it becomes a more attractive target for malicious actors. Threats to the Cardano network could result in financial loss, reputation damage, and even the compromise of user data.

By proactively gathering and analyzing threat intelligence, the Cardano community can stay ahead of potential threats and mitigate them before they cause harm.

## How is Cardano Threat Intelligence gathered?

There are many ways to gather threat intelligence, including:

- Monitoring social media, forums, and other online communities for discussions about potential threats
- Analyzing network traffic to identify unusual patterns or behaviors
- Gathering data on known vulnerabilities in Cardano and related technologies
- Collaborating with other security experts and organizations to share information and insights
- Conducting threat modeling exercises to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities proactively by auditors and blockchain security researchers.

These are just a few examples, but there are many other ways that Cardano Threat Intelligence can be gathered and analyzed to ensure the security of the network.

## What are the benefits of Cardano Threat Intelligence?

By regularly analyzing and acting on threat intelligence, the Cardano community can:

- Identify potential threats before they cause harm
- Improve the overall security posture of the Cardano network
- Mitigate potential financial, reputational, and operational risks
- Stay ahead of emerging threats and vulnerabilities

## How Does the Cardano Threat Intelligence Repository Categorize Vulnerabilities?

The Cardano Threat Intelligence repository uses a folder structure to categorize vulnerabilities by the different layers of Cardano's blockchain. The folders are categorized into network, on-chain, and off-chain categories. Each vulnerability is then numbered by the CTI as a reference method.
The Cardano Threat Intelligence (CTI) repository categorizes vulnerabilities based on a standardized numbering system.

Format: CTI-YYYY-AAA-TTNN

CTI: Acronym for "Cardano Threat Intelligence"
YYYY: A four-digit year of discovery
AAA: A three-letter identifier that represents the protocol or network (e.g., ADA for Cardano mainchain, MKD for Milkomeda sidechain, etc.)
TT: A two-digit combination of high-level category and subcategory codes representing the type of threat/vulnerability. The following categories and subcategories have been established:

- 10: On-chain vulnerabilities
  - 01: Smart contract vulnerabilities
  - 02: Consensus mechanism vulnerabilities
  - 03: Governance vulnerabilities
  - 04: Token standards and contract library vulnerabilities
- 20: Off-chain vulnerabilities
  - 01: Oracle-related vulnerabilities
  - 02: Sidechain-related vulnerabilities
  - 03: Delegation vulnerabilities
- 30: Network vulnerabilities
  - 01: DDoS attack vulnerabilities
  - 02: Peer-to-peer network attack vulnerabilities
  - 03: Routing attack vulnerabilities
- 40: Miscellaneous vulnerabilities

NN: A two-digit vulnerability number assigned within the given category and subcategory

Examples:

- CTI-2021-ADA-1101: Reentrancy vulnerability in Cardano smart contract
- CTI-2022-MKD-2202: Incorrect handling of error conditions in Milkomeda oracle
- CTI-2023-ADA-3101: DDoS attack on Cardano network
- CTI-2024-MKD-3302: Routing attack on Milkomeda

This numbering system provides a more comprehensive way to categorize different types of vulnerabilities for the Cardano ecosystem, with a lot of available sub-categories without having to compromise on the length of the code used in the numbering system. By assigning two-digit categories and two-digit codes to individual vulnerabilities, it simplifies vulnerability tracking and knowledge sharing among security researchers, developers and blockchain experts wanted to dig deeper into a particular vulnerability or category.

## How can others collaborate and contribute to Cardano Threat Intelligence?

Cardano Threat Intelligence repository is an open-source project that thrives on collaboration and contributions from developers, security researchers, and enthusiasts with a passion for improving cybersecurity on the Cardano network. If you are interested in making a contribution, there are multiple ways to do so.

- Fork the repository, create changes and submit a pull request to collaborate with others in the project. Collaborating with other developers through pull requests can help improve the system's functionality and ensure that every new release contains the most up-to-date threat intelligence.
- Identify new cybersecurity risks on the Cardano network and report them to the project's development team. This can help keep the threat intelligence repository up to date with the most current risks and vulnerabilities.
- Help create new tools and features to improve the system. This can include developing additional cybersecurity tools, implementing security best practices, or improving code quality. These adjustments can be suggested through a pull request, ensuring that other developers have the ability to collaborate on new ideas and innovations.

## Conclusion

The Cardano Threat Intelligence repository is an essential element in providing a comprehensive and proactive approach to vulnerability reporting. Its function is to identify and mitigate potential threats, ensuring the security and reliability of the Cardano blockchain's dApps and software components. By collecting and analyzing threat intelligence, the Cardano community can stay ahead of potential threats and safeguard the platform from damage.
