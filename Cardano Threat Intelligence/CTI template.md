# CTI-YYYY-AAA-TTNN: The Vulnerability Title

Change the CTI reference method to appropriate format.

## Author

Provide information about the person or team who found the vulnerability. This may include the names and roles of the individuals involved, their organization or company, and their contact information. It may also include any relevant certifications or qualifications held by the individuals or team.  

### Summary

Provide a brief summary of the vulnerability finding, including a descriptive title that accurately describes the vulnerability found.

### Description

Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including the system or software affected, and how it was discovered. Include any relevant background information that may help stakeholders understand the problem. Also, describe the impact of the vulnerability. Use clear and concise language to help stakeholders understand the problem.

### Risk Assessment

- **Likelihood/Difficulty:** Evaluate the difficulty of exploiting the vulnerability, including the level of skill and resources required by an attacker to carry out an attack.
- **Impact:** Evaluate the potential impact of the vulnerability on the system, organization, and users, ranging from Low to High.
- **Severity:** Assign a severity level to the vulnerability based on the risk assessment, ranging from High to Informational.

The impact levels can be defined as follows:

- **Low:** Vulnerabilities that have minimal impact on system confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
- **Medium:** Vulnerabilities that have moderate impact on system confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
- **High:** Vulnerabilities that have significant impact on system confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

The severity levels can be defined as follows:

- **High:** Vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited with a high impact.
- **Medium:** Vulnerabilities that can be exploited with some effort or have moderate impact.
- **Low:** Vulnerabilities that require significant effort to exploit or have low impact.
- **Informational:** Vulnerabilities that do not pose a significant risk by themselves but may provide useful information for attackers or reveal deficiencies in the security posture of the system.

As part of your risk assessment, describe the potential impact of the vulnerability on the organization and any potential legal or regulatory consequences also please note that the severity level should be determined based on the combined assessment of likelihood/difficulty and impact.

### Steps to Reproduce

Provide a detailed guide on how to reproduce the vulnerability. The guide should include step-by-step instructions. Provide all relevant information to allow stakeholders to replicate the vulnerability, including information on the system environment,tools and tests used to reproduce the vulnerability.

### Technical Details

Include any technical details relevant to the vulnerability. This may include following technical details that are relevant to the vulnerability:

- Tools used
- Methodology (methods used to identify the vulnerability)
- Affected software versions
- Smart contracts that contain vulnerable code.
- Affected system configurations
- Blockchain networks using smart contracts.
- Examples of vulnerable code snippets.

Use technical language that stakeholders can understand but be as specific as possible. Also provide information about other type of vulnerabilities that may be related to or caused the CTI vulnerability (i.e., buffer overflow, SQL injection) and the attack vector used to exploit it.

### Mitigation & Remediation Steps

List recommended remediation steps to fix the vulnerability. Include any recommended patches, software updates, changes to system configuration or coding best practice that will fix the vulnerability. Describe how long the fix will take, the resources needed for implementation, and any potential implementation challenges. Also, recommend any workarounds (code snippets if needed) to mitigate the consequences of the vulnerability while the fix is being implemented.

### References

Include any relevant references or sources used during the vulnerability assessment, such as vendor advisories, known vulnerability databases, and industry-standard security guidelines and best practices.
