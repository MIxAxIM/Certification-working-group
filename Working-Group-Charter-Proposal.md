**Repository and Deliverable Development**

**Process**
The repository is designed to simplify and consolidate GitHub status tracking of work items managed by the Cardano certification alliance Working Group.

Proposed workflow

**Idea:**  Any Working Group member may submit a proposed idea as a candidate. This will be raised as **an issue in Github**. The Working Group will agree if they want to work on this.

**Pre-Draft**. If The Working Group decides to work on one of the ideas, a member will create a branch that points to the corresponding issue and uploads one or more documents (as text markdown files). Then the Working Group members work on the documents until a first draft is complete.

**Draft.** Once the documents are ready for review, a **Pull Request** is created, assigning at least two reviewers.

**Review.** The Working Group members will review the documents and make any **comments** or suggestions. An iterative process starts with the interaction between reviewers and the draft’s editors.

**Working Group Approval.** Once every comment is solved and reviewers are happy with the documents, the PR is approved. Then the branch is ready to be merged into the master branch.
