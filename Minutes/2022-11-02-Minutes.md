### Beginning of the meeting:
* There is a new discord for the alliance, independant from IOG.
* Further meetings will be done from discord directly.
* Andre Knispel was presented to the group as an IOG engineer who is
  formalizing the Ledger in Agda.
* Andre was there to present his work and discuss ledger corner cases
  that might not be known by the group members and might be absent
  from simplified models.
* The meeting is being recorded by Simon Thompson.

### Andre's presentation: 

* Prerequisite of the formal model:
  * The specification is written in natural deduction style
  * There is a context, a state space and a transition function
  * The context could possibly be embedded into the state if needed
  * The rules describe which transactions can be executed
  * There is an embedded state machine called ppup
* Corner cases that are taken into account by the formal model:
  * Byron addresses should be handled because they are still used by
    old scripts
  * Max transaction size
  * Fees
  * Limit of the maximal amount of collateral inputs (limited to 1
    currently)
  * Maximum value size to prevent people from creating unspendable
    outputs
  * Ada entries are non negative
* In addition, some changes to the ledger state only apply for
  transaction whose scripts have successfully run. Thus, each
  transaction has to be seen as a pair of transactions (success,
  failure). In case of failure, the collateral is consumed. This is
  important when watching the chain from outside, not necessarily when
  writing scripts.
* Current state of the Agda formalization:
  * It’s not ready for use yet, although it has progressed a lot
  * It should be testable “soon-ish” against a concrete implementation
  * They will develop a version without corner cases to be simpler to
    use
  * They will prove conformity properties between the two as well as
    missing elements
  * The rationale is that most user will most likely not be in these
    corner cases
  * They want to be able to prove properties between eras as well
  * They plan to retire the latex specification in favor of this when
    it's mature enough

### End of meeting additional topics:

* The group will be renamed the Certification working group to align
  with other groups
* The goal is to have a page in Cardano approval
* There will be a communication in Edimbourg organized by IOG in
  parallel to the Cardano Summit in Lausanne.
* The overall goal is to promote the group and attract new members

### Agenda for the next meeting:

A proposal was made to discuss about level one certification as a
whole.
